Quantifying Binary Tree Comparison
We may often obtain two different phylogenies on the same collection of taxa from different
sets of data.  As a result, we would like to have a way of quantifying how much
the two phylogenies differ.  In the simplest case, we would like to compare the characters
of two phylogenies.
Recall from “Counting Unrooted Binary Trees” that two unrooted binary trees are equivalent
when they have the same set of splits; recall also (by extension of “Counting Phylogenetic Ancestors”) that any unrooted
binary tree on n taxa must have n - 3 nontrivial splits.

Problem
Define the split distance between two unrooted binary trees as the number of nontrivial splits
contained in one tree but not the other.
Formally, if s(T_1, T_2) denotes the number of nontrivial splits shared by unrooted binary trees T_1 and T_2,
Then their split distance is d_{\textrm{split}}(T_1, T_2) = 2(n-3) - 2s(T_1, T_2).
Given: A collection of at most 3,000 species taxa and two unrooted binary trees T_1 and T_2
on these taxa in Newick format.
Return: The split distance d_{\textrm{split}}(T_1, T_2).
