Problem
Figure 1. The graph from the dataset

The task is to use Bellman-Ford algorithm to compute single-source shortest distances
in a directed graph with possibly negative edge weights (but without negative cycles).
Given: A simple directed graph with integer edge weights from -10^{3} to 10^3 and n \le 10^3 vertices in the edge list format.
Return: An array D[1..n] where D[i] is the length of a shortest path from the vertex 1 to the vertex i
(D[1]=0). If i is not reachable from 1 set D[i] to x.
See Figure 1 for visual example from the sample dataset.
