Introduction to Quartet-Based Phylogeny
In “Quartets”, we introduced partial splits modeling partial characters on
a collection of taxa.  Our aim is to use the quartets inferred from
partial splits to construct a phylogeny on the taxa.  This procedure is called
quartet-based phylogeny.
We could construct a phylogeny directly from a collection of partial splits, but
it is not immediately clear how many different splits we would need.
Hence, our first question is to ask how many quartets are required to
be able to infer a tree; in this problem we will ask the reverse question of how many
quartets can be inferred from a known tree.

Problem
A quartet AB \mid CD is consistent with a binary tree T
if the quartet can be inferred from one of the splits of T (see “Quartets” for
a description of inferring quartets from splits).
Let q(T) denote the total number of quartets that are consistent with T.
Given: A positive integer n (4 \leq n \leq 5000), followed by an unrooted binary tree T
in Newick format on n taxa.
Return: The value of q(T) modulo 1,000,000.
