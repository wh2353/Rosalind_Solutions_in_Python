Problem
An inversion of an array A[1..n] is a pair of indices (i,j) such that 1 \le i < j \le n and A[i] > A[j].
The number of inversions shows how far the array is from being sorted: if it is already sorted then there are no
inversions, whereas if it is sorted in reverse order then the number of inversions is maximal.
Given: A positive integer n \le 10^5 and an array A[1..n] of integers from -10^5 to 10^5.
Return: The number of inversions in A.
