Problem
A partition procedure is an essential part of the Quick Sort algorithm, the subject of one of the following problems.
Its main goal is to put the first element of a given array to its proper place in a sorted array.
It can be implemented in linear time, by a single scan of a given array. Moreover,
it is not hard to come up with an in-place algorithm.

Given: A positive integer n \le 10^5 and an array A[1..n] of integers from -10^5 to 10^5.
Return: A permuted array B[1..n] such that it is a permutation of A and there is an index 1 \le q \le n such that
B[i] \le A[1] for all 1 \le i \le q-1, B[q]=A[1], and B[i] > A[1] for all q+1 \le i \le n.
