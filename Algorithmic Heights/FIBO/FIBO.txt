Fibonacci numbers
The Fibonacci numbers grow almost as fast as the powers of 2: for example, F_{30} is
over a million, and F_{100} is already 21 digits long! In general, F_n \approx 2^{0.694n}.
No other sequence of numbers has been studied as extensively, or applied to more fields:
biology, demography, art, architecture, music, to name just a few. And, together with the
powers of 2, it is computer scienceâ€™s favorite sequence.

Problem
The Fibonacci numbers 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, \dots are generated by the following simple rule
F_n = 
 \begin{cases}
   F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}, & n > 1\, ,\\
   1,               & n=1  \, ,\\
   0,               & n=0  \, .\\
 \end{cases}
Given: A positive integer n \le 25.
Return: The value of F_n.
