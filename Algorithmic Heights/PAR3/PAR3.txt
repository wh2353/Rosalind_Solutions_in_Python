Problem
This problem is very similar to “2-Way Partition”, but now the goal is to partition an input array more carefully.

Given: A positive integer n \le 10^5 and an array A[1..n] of integers from -10^5 to 10^5.
Return: An array B[1..n] such that it is a permutation of A and there are indices 1 \le q \le r \le n such that
B[i] < A[1] for all 1 \le i \le q-1, B[i]=A[1] for all q \le i \le r, and B[i] > A[1] for all r+1 \le i \le n.
