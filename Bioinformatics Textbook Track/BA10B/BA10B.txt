Probability of an Outcome Given a Hidden Path Problem
Given: A string x, followed by the alphabet Σ from which x was constructed, followed by a hidden path π, followed by the states States and emission matrix Emission of an HMM (Σ, States, Transition, Emission).
Return: The conditional probability Pr(x|π) that string x will be emitted by the HMM given the hidden path π.
