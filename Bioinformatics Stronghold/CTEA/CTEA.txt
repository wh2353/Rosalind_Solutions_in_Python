Beware of Alignment Inference
In “Edit Distance Alignment”, we introduced the concept of an alignment of two genetic strings
having differing lengths with respect to edit distance.
This provided us with a way of visualizing a specific collection of
symbol substitutions, insertions, and deletions that could have taken place on the
evolutionary path between the two strings.
However, simply finding one optimal alignment and declaring that it represents a true
evolutionary history is a dangerous idea because the actual evolutionary picture may be
suboptimal.  For that matter, the collection of all optimal alignments may be huge,
and the characteristics of these alignments could differ widely.
In order to begin analyzing the collection of optimal alignments for a pair of strings,
the first question we will ask is simple: just how many optimal alignments exist?

Problem
Recall from “Edit Distance Alignment” that if s' and t' are the augmented strings corresponding
to an alignment of strings s and t, then the edit alignment score of s' and t'
was given by the Hamming distance d_{\textrm{H}}(s', t') (because s' and t' have
the same length and already include gap symbols to denote insertions/deletions).
As a result, we obtain d_{\textrm{E}}(s, t) = \min_{s', t'}{d_{\textrm{H}}(s', t')}, where the minimum
is taken over all alignments of s and t.  Strings s' and t' achieving this minimum
correspond to an optimal alignment with respect to edit alignment score.
Given: Two protein strings s and t in FASTA format, each of length at most 1000 aa.
Return: The total number of optimal alignments of s and t with respect to edit
alignment score, modulo 134,217,727 (227-1).
