Problem
Figure 1. The graph from the dataset

The task is to use breadth-first search to compute single-source shortest distances
in an unweighted directed graph.
Given: A simple directed graph with n \le 10^3 vertices in the edge list format.
Return: An array D[1..n] where D[i] is the length of a shortest path from the vertex 1 to the vertex i
(D[1]=0). If i is not reachable from 1 set D[i] to -1.
See Figure 1 for visual example from the sample dataset.
