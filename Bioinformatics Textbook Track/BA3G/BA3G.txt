In “Find an Eulerian Cycle in a Graph”, we defined an Eulerian cycle. A path that traverses each edge of a graph exactly once (but does not necessarily return to its starting node is called an Eulerian path.
Eulerian Path Problem
Find an Eulerian path in a graph.
Given: A directed graph that contains an Eulerian path, where the graph is given in the form of an adjacency list.
Return: An Eulerian path in this graph.
