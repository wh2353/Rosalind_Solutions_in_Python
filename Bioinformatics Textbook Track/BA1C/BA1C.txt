In DNA strings, symbols 'A' and 'T' are complements of each other, as are 'C' and 'G'.  Given a nucleotide p, we denote its complementary nucleotide as p. The reverse complement of a DNA string Pattern = p1…pn is the string Pattern = pn … p1 formed by taking the complement of each nucleotide in Pattern, then reversing the resulting string.
For example, the reverse complement of Pattern = "GTCA" is Pattern = "TGAC".
