Problem
The heap sort algorithm first transforms a given array into a max heap (recall the problem “Building a Heap”).
It then repeats the following two simple steps n-1 times:  

Swap the last element of the heap with its root and decrease the size of the heap by 1.
"Sift-down" the new root element to its proper place.

Given: A positive integer n \le 10^5 and an array A[1..n] of integers from -10^5 to 10^5.
Return: A sorted array A.
