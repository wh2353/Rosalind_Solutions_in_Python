In “Find the Longest Repeat in a String”, we encountered the Longest Repeat Problem, which could be solved using a suffix tree.
The second additional exercise that we will consider is below.
Longest Shared Substring Problem
Find the longest substring shared by two strings.
Given: Strings Text1 and Text2.
Return: The longest substring that occurs in both Text1 and Text2. (Multiple solutions may exist, in which case you may return any one.)
