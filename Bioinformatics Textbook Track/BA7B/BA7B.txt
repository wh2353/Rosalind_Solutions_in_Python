Limb Length Problem
Find the limb length for a leaf in a tree.
Given: An integer n, followed by an integer j between 0 and n - 1, followed by a space-separated additive distance matrix D (whose elements are integers).
Return: The limb length of the leaf in Tree(D) corresponding to row j of this distance matrix (use 0-based indexing).
