Gaps on the Ends are Free
We have covered both global and local alignments.  However,
sometimes we need a hybrid approach that avoids the weaknesses of these two methods.
One such alternate approach is that of fitting alignments outlined in “Finding a Motif with Modifications”.
Another tactic is to allow ourselves to trim off gaps appearing on the ends
of a global alignment for free; this is relevant if one of our strings to be aligned
happens to contain additional symbols on the ends that are not relevant for the particular
alignment at hand.

Problem
A semiglobal alignment of strings s and t is an alignment in which any gaps appearing
as prefixes or suffixes of s and t do not contribute to the alignment score.
Semiglobal alignment has sometimes also been called "overlap alignment".  Rosalind defines
overlap alignment differently (see “Overlap Alignment”).
Given: Two DNA strings s and t in FASTA format, each having length at most 10 kbp.
Return: The maximum semiglobal alignment score of s and t, followed by an alignment of s
and t achieving this maximum score.  Use an alignment score in which matching symbols
count +1, substitutions count -1, and there is a linear gap penalty of 1.
If multiple optimal alignments exist, then you may return any one.
