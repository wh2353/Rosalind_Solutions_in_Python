We will use 2-Break(1, 6, 3, 8) two denote the 2-break replacing colored edges (1, 6) and (3, 8) in a genome graph with two new colored edges (1, 3) and (6, 8).  Note that the order of the nodes in this function matter, since the operation 2-Break(1, 6, 8, 3) would represent a different 2-break that replaces (1, 6) and (3, 8) with (1, 8) and (6, 3).
The following pseudocode describes how 2-Break(i, i′, j, j′) transforms a genome graph.

2-BreakOnGenomeGraph(GenomeGraph, i, i′, j, j′)     remove colored edges (i, i') and (j, j′) from GenomeGraph     add colored edges (i, j) and (i′, j') to GenomeGraph     return GenomeGraph
