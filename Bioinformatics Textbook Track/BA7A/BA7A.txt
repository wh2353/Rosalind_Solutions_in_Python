In this chapter, we define the length of a path in a tree as the sum of the lengths of its edges (rather than the number of edges on the path). As a result, the evolutionary distance between two present-day species corresponding to leaves i and j in a tree T is equal to the length of the unique path connecting i and j, denoted di, j(T).
Distance Between Leaves Problem
Compute the distances between leaves in a weighted tree.
Given: An integer n followed by the adjacency list of a weighted tree with n leaves.
Return: A space-separated n x n (di, j), where di, j is the length of the path between leaves i and j.
