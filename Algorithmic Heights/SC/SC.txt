Problem
A directed graph is semi-connected if for all pairs of vertices i,j there is either a path from
i to j or a path from j to i.
Given: A positive integer k \le 20 and k simple directed graphs with at most 10^3 vertices each in the edge list format.
Return: For each graph, output "1" if the graph is semi-connected and "-1" otherwise.
