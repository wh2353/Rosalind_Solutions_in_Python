Another Tree Distance
In “Phylogeny Comparison with Split Distance”, we examined the split distance for comparison of different phylogenies
on the same collection of taxa.
Yet quartet-based phylogeny offers another way in which two phylogenies
can be compared (see “Quartets” and “Counting Quartets”).  Specifically, we wonder how
many quartets can be inferred from one tree but not inferred from the other.

Problem
In “Counting Quartets”, we found an expression for q(T), the number of quartets that can be inferred from
an unrooted binary tree containing n taxa.
If T_1 and T_2 are both unrooted binary trees on the same n taxa, then we now let q(T_1, T_2)
denote the number of inferred quartets that are common to both trees.
The quartet distance between T_1 and T_2, d_{\textrm{q}}(T_1, T_2) is the number of
quartets that are only inferred from one of the trees.  More precisely, d_\textrm{q}(T_1, T_2) = q(T_1) + q(T_2) - 2q(T_1, T_2).
Given: A list containing n taxa (n \leq 2000) and two unrooted binary trees T_1 and T_2
on the given taxa.  Both T_1 and T_2 are given in Newick format.
Return: The quartet distance d_\textrm{q}(T_1, T_2).
