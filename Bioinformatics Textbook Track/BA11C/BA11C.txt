Given an amino acid string Peptide = a1 . . . an of length n, we will represent its prefix masses using a binary peptide vector Peptide' with mass(Peptide) coordinates. This vector contains a 1 at each of the n prefix coordinates
mass(a1), mass(a1 a2), . . . , mass(a1 a2 . . . an ) ,
and it contains a 0 in each of the remaining noise coordinates. The toy peptide XZZXX, whose prefix masses are 4, 9, 14, 18, and 22, corresponds to the peptide vector (0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1) of length 22.
Converting Peptide into Peptide Vector Problem
Convert a peptide into a binary peptide vector.
Given: A peptide P.
Return: The peptide vector of P.
Note: In this chapter, all dataset problems implicitly use the standard integer-valued mass table for the regular twenty amino acids. Examples sometimes use imaginary amino acids X and Z having respective integer masses 4 and 5.
