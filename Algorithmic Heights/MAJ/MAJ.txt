Problem
An array A[1..n] is said to have a majority element if more than half of its entries are the
same.
Given: A positive integer k \le 20, a positive integer n \le 10^4, and k arrays of size n
containing positive integers not exceeding 10^5.
Return: For each array, output an element of this array occurring strictly more than n/2 times
if such element exists, and "-1" otherwise.
