Getting Real with Spectra
In “Inferring Peptide from Full Spectrum”, we considered an idealized version of the simplified spectrum in which
every cut through a given peptide was produced, so that the spectrum possessed all
possible b-ions and y-ions cutting the peptide.
In reality, not every cut will be produced in a spectrum, which may also contain errors.
As a result, it is difficult or impossible to recover an entire peptide from a single spectrum.
In the more practical case of a mass spectrum, where intensity is plotted against
ions' mass-charge ratios, inferring the protein is also greatly complicated by the
presence of erratic peaks in the spectrum.

Problem
For a weighted alphabet \mathscr{A} and a collection L of positive real numbers, the
spectrum graph of L is a digraph constructed in the following way.  First, create a node
for every real number in L.  Then, connect a pair of nodes with a directed edge (u, v)
if v > u and v - u is equal to the weight of a single symbol in \mathscr{A}.  We may
then label the edge with this symbol.
In this problem, we say that a weighted string s = s_1 s_2 \cdots s_n matches L if there is some increasing sequence
of positive real numbers (w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_{n+1}) in L such that w(s_1) = w_2 - w_1, 
w(s_2) = w_3 - w_2, ..., and w(s_n) = w_{n+1} - w_{n}.
Given: A list L (of length at most 100) containing positive real numbers.
Return: The longest protein string that matches the spectrum graph of L
(if multiple solutions exist, you may output any one of them).  Consult the monoisotopic mass table.
