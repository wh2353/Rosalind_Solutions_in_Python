The first potential issue with implementing MedianString from “Find a Median String” is writing a function to
compute d(Pattern, Dna) = ∑ti=1 d(Pattern, Dnai), the sum of distances between Pattern and each string in Dna = {Dna1, ..., Dnat}.
This task is achieved by the following pseudocode.

DistanceBetweenPatternAndStrings(Pattern, Dna)    k ← |Pattern|    distance ← 0    for each string Text in Dna        HammingDistance ← ∞        for each k-mer Pattern’ in Text            if HammingDistance > HammingDistance(Pattern, Pattern’)                HammingDistance ← HammingDistance(Pattern, Pattern’)        distance ← distance + HammingDistance    return distance

Compute DistanceBetweenPatternAndStrings
Find the distance between a pattern and a set of strings.
Given: A DNA string Pattern and a collection of DNA strings Dna.
Return: DistanceBetweenPatternAndStrings(Pattern, Dna).
