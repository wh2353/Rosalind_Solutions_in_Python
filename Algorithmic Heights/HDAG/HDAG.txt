Problem
A Hamiltonian path is a path in a graph that visits each vertex exactly once.
Checking whether a graph contains a Hamiltonian path is a well-known hard problem.
At the same time it is easy to perform such a check if a given graph is a DAG.
Given: A positive integer k \le 20 and k simple directed acyclic graphs in the edge list format with at most 10^3 vertices each.
Return: For each graph, if it contains a Hamiltonian path output "1" followed by a Hamiltonian path (i.e., a list of vertices), otherwise output "-1".
