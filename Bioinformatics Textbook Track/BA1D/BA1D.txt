In this problem, we ask a simple question: how many times can one string occur as a substring of another? Recall from “Find the Most Frequent Words in a String” that different occurrences of a substring can overlap with each other.  For example,  \color{green}\textbf{ATA} occurs three times in \text{CG}\color{green}\textbf{ATATA}\color{black}\text{TCC}\color{green}\textbf{ATA}\color{black}\text{G}.
