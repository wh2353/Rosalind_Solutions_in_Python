Counting Trees
A natural question is to be able to count the total number of distinct unrooted binary trees
having n leaves, where each leaf is labeled by some taxon.  Before we can count
all these trees, however, we need to have a notion of when two such trees are the same.
Our tool will be the split.  Recall from “Creating a Character Table” that removing any edge from
a tree T separates its leaves into sets S and S^{\textrm{c}}, so that
each edge of T can be labeled by this split S \mid S^{\textrm{c}}.  As a result,
an unrooted binary tree can be represented uniquely by its collection of splits.

Problem
Two unrooted binary trees T_1 and T_2 having the same n labeled leaves
are considered to be equivalent if there is some assignment of labels to the internal nodes
of T_1 and T_2 so that the adjacency lists of the two trees coincide.
As a result, note that T_1 and T_2 must have the same splits; conversely, if the two trees do not
have the same splits, then they are considered distinct.
Let b(n) denote the total number of distinct unrooted binary trees having n labeled leaves.
Given: A positive integer n (n \leq 1000).
Return: The value of b(n) modulo 1,000,000.
