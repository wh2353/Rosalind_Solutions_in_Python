Figure 1. The graphs from the dataset

A bipartite graph is a graph G = (V, E) whose vertices can be partitioned into two sets (V = V_1 \cup V_2
and V_1 \cap V_2 = \emptyset) such that there are no edges between vertices in the same set (for instance, if
u, v \in V_1, then there is no edge between u and v).
There are many other ways to formulate this property. For instance, an undirected graph
is bipartite if and only if it can be colored with just two colors. Another one: an undirected graph is 
bipartite if and only if it contains no cycles of odd length.

Given: A positive integer k \le 20 and k simple graphs in the edge list format with at most 10^3 vertices each.
Return: For each graph, output "1" if it is bipartite and "-1" otherwise.
