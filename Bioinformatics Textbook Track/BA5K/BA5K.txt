Middle Edge in Linear Space Problem
Find a middle edge in the alignment graph in linear space.
Given: Two amino acid strings.
Return: A middle edge in the alignment graph of these strings, where the optimal path is defined by the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix and a linear indel penalty equal to 5. Return the middle edge in the form “(i, j) (k, l)”, where (i, j) connects to (k, l).
