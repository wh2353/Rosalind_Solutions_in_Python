Given: A string x, followed by the alphabet Σ from which x was constructed, followed by the states States, transition matrix Transition, and emission matrix Emission of an HMM (Σ, States, Transition, Emission).
Return: A path that maximizes the (unconditional) probability Pr(x, π) over all possible paths π.
