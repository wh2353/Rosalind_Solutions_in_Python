Incomplete Characters
The modern revolution in genome sequencing has produced a huge amount of genetic data
for a wide variety of species.  One ultimate goal of possessing all this information is to be able to construct
complete phylogenies via direct genome analysis.
For example, say that we have a gene shared by a number of taxa.  We could create a
character based on whether species are known to possess the gene or not, and then use a huge
character table to construct our desired phylogeny.  However, the present bottleneck with such a
method is that it assumes that we already possess complete genome information for all possible species.
The race is on to sequence as many species genomes as possible; for instance,
the Genome 10K Project aims to sequence 10,000 species genomes over the
next decade.  Yet for the time being, possessing a complete genomic picture of all Earth's species remains a dream.
As a result of these practical limitations, we need to be able to work with partial characters, which divide taxa into
three separate groups: those possessing the character, those not possessing the character,
and those for which we do not yet have conclusive information.  

Problem
A partial split of a set S of n taxa models a partial character and
is denoted by A \mid B, where A and B are still the two disjoint subsets of taxa divided
by the character. Unlike in the case of splits, we do not necessarily require that A \cup B = S;
(A \cup B)^{\textrm{c}} corresponds to those taxa for which we lack conclusive evidence regarding the character.
We can assemble a collection of partial characters into a generalized partial character table C
in which the symbol x is placed in C_{i, j} if we do not have conclusive evidence regarding
the jth taxon with respect to the ith partial character.
A quartet is a partial split A \mid B in which both A and B contain precisely two elements.
For the sake of simplicity, we often will consider quartets instead of partial characters.
We say that a quartet A \mid B is inferred from a partial split C \mid D if A \subseteq C and B \subseteq D
(or equivalently A \subseteq D and B \subseteq C).  For example, \{1, 3\} \mid \{2, 4\} 
and \{3, 5\} \mid \{2, 4\} can be inferred from \{1, 3, 5\} \mid \{2, 4\}.
Given: A partial character table C.
Return: The collection of all quartets that can be inferred from the splits corresponding to the underlying characters of C.
