From Characters Toward Alignments
In “Creating a Character Table from Genetic Strings”, we used strings to create a collection of characters from which
we could create a phylogeny.  However, the strings all had to share the same length,
which was a problem.  In practice, we would like to create a phylogeny from genetic strings
having differing lengths; specifically, our aim is to construct a phylogeny from a multiple
alignment.
Unfortunately, constructing a phylogeny from the ground up based only on an alignment can
be difficult. In order to produce an efficient solution, we will need to assume
that the structure of the phylogeny has already been provided (perhaps from character-based methods),
and our aim instead is to reconstruct the genetic strings corresponding to the internal nodes
(i.e., ancestors) in the tree.
The ancestor strings should have the property that the total
number of point mutations separating adjacent nodes in the tree is minimized
(in keeping with parsimony).

Problem
Say that we have n taxa represented by strings s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n with
a multiple alignment inducing corresponding augmented strings \overline{s}_1, \overline{s}_2, \ldots, \overline{s}_n.
Recall that the number of single-symbol substitutions required to transform one string into
another is the Hamming distance between the strings (see “Counting Point Mutations”).  Say that we have a rooted binary tree T
containing \overline{s}_1, \overline{s}_2, \ldots, \overline{s}_n at its leaves and additional strings
\overline{s}_{n+1}, \overline{s}_{n+2}, \ldots, \overline{s}_{2n-1} at its internal nodes,
including the root (the number of internal nodes is n-1 by extension of “Counting Phylogenetic Ancestors”).
Define d_{\textrm{H}}(T) as the sum of d_{\textrm{H}}(\overline{s}_i, \overline{s}_j) over
all edges \{\overline{s}_i, \overline{s}_j\} in T:
d_{\textrm{H}}(T) = \sum\limits_{\{\overline{s}_i, \overline{s}_j\} \in E(T)}{d_{\textrm{H}}(\overline{s}_i, \overline{s}_j)}
Thus, our aim is to minimize d_{\textrm{H}}(T).
Given: A rooted binary tree T on n (n \leq 500) species, given in Newick format, followed by
a multiple alignment of m (m \leq n) augmented DNA strings having the same length (at most 300 bp)
corresponding to the species and given in FASTA format.
Return: The minimum possible value of d_{\textrm{H}}(T), followed by a collection of DNA strings
to be assigned to the internal nodes of T that will minimize d_{\textrm{H}}(T)
(multiple solutions will exist, but you need only output one).
