Given a k-mer Pattern and a longer string Text, we use d(Pattern, Text) to denote the minimum Hamming distance between Pattern and any k-mer in Text,
d(\textit{Pattern}, \textit{Text}) = \min\limits_{\text{all k-mers Pattern' in Text}}{HammingDistance(Pattern, Pattern')}.
Given a k-mer Pattern and a set of strings Dna = {Dna1, â€¦ , Dnat}, we define d(Pattern, Dna) as the sum of distances between Pattern and all strings in Dna,
d(\textit{Pattern},\textit{Dna}) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^t d(\textit{Pattern},\textit{Dna}_i).
Our goal is to find a k-mer Pattern that minimizes d(Pattern, Dna) over all k-mers Pattern, the same task that the Equivalent Motif Finding Problem is trying to achieve.  We call such a k-mer a median string for Dna.
Median String Problem
Find a median string.
Given: An integer k and a collection of strings Dna. 
Return: A k-mer Pattern that minimizes d(Pattern, Dna) over all k-mers Pattern. (If multiple answers exist, you may return any one.)
