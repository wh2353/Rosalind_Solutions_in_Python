Problem
The merging procedure is an essential part of “Merge Sort” (which is considered in one of the next problems).
Given: A positive integer n \le 10^5 and a sorted array A[1..n] of integers from -10^5 to 10^5,
a positive integer m \le 10^5 and a sorted array B[1..m] of integers from -10^5 to 10^5.
Return: A sorted array C[1..n+m] containing all the elements of A and B.
