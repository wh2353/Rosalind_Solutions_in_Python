Introduction to Distance-Based Phylogeny
A number of different approaches are used to build phylogenies, each one featuring its own computational
strengths and weaknesses.  One of these measures is distance-based phylogeny,
which constructs a tree from evolutionary distances calculated between pairs of taxa.
A wide assortment of different measures exist for quantifying this evolutionary distance.
Once we have selected a distance function and used it to calculate the distance
between every pair of taxa, we place these pairwise distance functions into a table.
In this problem, we will consider an evolutionary function based on Hamming distance.  Recall from
“Counting Point Mutations” that this function compares two homologous strands of DNA by counting 
the minimum possible number of point mutations that could have occurred on the
evolutionary path between the two strands.

Problem
For two strings s_1 and s_2 of equal length, the p-distance between them,
denoted d_p(s_1, s_2), is the proportion of corresponding symbols that differ between s_1 and s_2.
For a general distance function d on n taxa s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n (taxa are often represented by genetic strings),
we may encode the distances between pairs of taxa via a distance matrix D in which D_{i,j} = d(s_i, s_j).
Given: A collection of n (n \leq 10) DNA strings s_1, \ldots, s_n of equal length (at most 1 kbp).
Strings are given in FASTA format.
Return: The matrix D corresponding to the p-distance d_p on the given strings.  As always,
note that your answer is allowed an absolute error of 0.001.
