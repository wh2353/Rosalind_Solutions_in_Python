Introduction to Character-Based Phylogeny
In “Creating a Character Table”, we discussed the construction of a character table from a
collection of characters represented by subsets of our taxa.
However, the ultimate goal is to be able to construct a phylogeny from this character table.
The issues at hand are that we want to ensure that we have enough characters to
actually construct a phylogeny, and that our characters do not conflict with
each other.

Problem
Because a tree having n nodes has n-1 edges (see “Completing a Tree”), removing a single edge from
a tree will produce two smaller, disjoint trees.  Recall from “Creating a Character Table” that for this reason, each
edge of an unrooted binary tree corresponds to a split S \mid S^{\textrm{c}}, where S is a subset of the taxa.
A consistent character table is one whose characters' splits do not conflict with the edge splits of some unrooted binary tree T on the n taxa.
More precisely, S_1 \mid S_1^{\textrm{c}} conflicts with S_2 \mid S_2^{\textrm{c}} if
all four intersections S_1 \cap S_2, S_1 \cap S_2^{\textrm{c}}, S_1^{\textrm{c}} \cap S_2, and
S_1^{\textrm{c}} \cap S_2^{\textrm{c}} are nonempty.
As a simple example, consider the conflicting splits \{a, b\} \mid \{c, d\} and \{a, c\} \mid \{b, d\}.
More generally, given a consistent character table C, an unrooted binary tree T
"models" C if the edge splits of T agree with the splits induced from the characters of C.
Given: A list of n species (n \leq 80) and an n-column character table C in which
the jth column denotes the jth species.
Return: An unrooted binary tree in Newick format that models C.
