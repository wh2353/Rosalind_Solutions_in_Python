Multiple Longest Common Subsequence Problem
Find a longest common subsequence of multiple strings.
Given: Three DNA strings.
Return: The maximum score of a multiple alignment of these three strings, followed by a multiple alignment of the three strings achieving this maximum. Use a scoring function in which the score of an alignment column is 1 if all three symbols are identical and 0 otherwise. (If more than one multiple alignment achieve the maximum, you may return any one.)
