The following algorithm constructs ColoredEdges(P) for a genome P. In this pseudocode, we will assume that an n-element array (a1, . . . , an) has an invisible (n + 1)-th element that is equal to its first element, i.e., an+1 = a1.
ColoredEdges(P)     Edges ← an empty set     for each chromosome Chromosome in P          Nodes ← ChromosomeToCycle(Chromosome)          for j ← 1 to |Chromosome|               add the edge (Nodes2j, Nodes2j +1) to Edges     return Edges
Colored Edges Problem
Find the Colored Edges in a genome.
Given: A genome P.
Return: The collection of colored edges in the genome graph of P in the form (x, y).
