Weighting the Tree
A vital goal of creating phylogenies is to quantify a molecular clock that indicates
the amount of evolutionary time separating two members of the phylogeny.  To this end, we will
assign numbers to the edges of a tree so that the number assigned to an edge represents
the amount of time separating the two species at each end of the edge.  More generally,
the evolutionary time between any two species will be given by simply adding the individual
times connecting the nodes.

Problem
In a weighted tree, each edge is assigned a (usually positive) number,
called its weight.  The distance between two nodes in a weighted tree becomes
the sum of the weights along the unique path connecting the nodes.
To generalize Newick format to the case of a weighted tree T, during our repeated "key step,"
if leaves v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n are neighbors in T,
and all these leaves are incident to u, then we replace u with (v_1:d_1, v_2:d_2, \ldots, v_n:d_n)u,
where d_i is now the weight on the edge \{v_i, u\}.
Given: A collection of n weighted trees (n \leq 40) in Newick format, with each tree containing at most 200 nodes;
each tree T_k is followed by a pair of nodes x_k and y_k in T_k.
Return: A collection of n numbers, for which the kth number represents the distance
between x_k and y_k in T_k.
