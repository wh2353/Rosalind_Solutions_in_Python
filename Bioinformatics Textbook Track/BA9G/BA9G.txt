In “Find the Longest Repeat in a String”, we saw that suffix trees can be too memory intensive to apply in practice.
In 1993, Udi Manber and Gene Myers introduced suffix arrays as a memory-efficient alternative to suffix trees. To construct SuffixArray(Text), we first sort all suffixes of Text lexicographically, assuming that "" comes first in the alphabet. The suffix array is the list of starting positions of these sorted suffixes. For example,
SuffixArray("panamabananas") = (13, 5, 3, 1, 7, 9, 11, 6, 4, 2, 8, 10, 0, 12).
Suffix Array Construction Problem
