You may have had the misfortune to participate in a team-building event
that featured the "human knot," in which everyone joins hands with two other people,
and the group must undo the giant knot of arms without letting go
(see Figure 1).
Let's consider a simplified version of the human knot. Say that we have an
even number of people at a party who are standing in a circle, and they pair off and shake
hands at the same time.  One combinatorial question at hand
asks us to count the total number of ways that the guests can shake hands without any
two pairs interfering with each other by crossing arms.
This silly little counting problem is actually an excellent analogy for RNA folding.
In practice, base pairing can occur anywhere along the RNA molecule, but the
secondary structure of RNA often forbids
base pairs crossing over each other, which forms a structure called a pseudoknot (see Figure 2)).
Pseudoknots are not technically knots, but they nevertheless cause RNA to fold over itself.
Forbidding pseudoknots offers an interesting wrinkle to the problem of counting potential RNA
secondary structures that we started working with in “Perfect Matchings and RNA Secondary Structures”, in which every possible nucleotide
of a strand of RNA must base pair with another nucleotide.

Problem
Figure 3. The only two noncrossing perfect matchings of basepair edges (shown in red) for the RNA string UAGCGUGAUCAC.

Figure 4. All possible noncrossing perfect matchings in complete graphs on 2, 4, 6, and 8 nodes; the total number of such matchings are 1, 2, 5, and 14, respectively.

A matching in a graph is noncrossing
if none of its edges cross each other.  If we assume that the n nodes
of this graph are arranged around a circle, and if we label these nodes with
positive integers between 1 and n, then a matching is noncrossing as long as there are
not edges \{i, j\} and \{k, l\} such that i < k < j < l.
A noncrossing matching of basepair edges in the bonding graph corresponding to
an RNA string will correspond to a possible secondary structure of the underlying
RNA strand that lacks pseudoknots, as shown in
Figure 3.
In this problem, we will consider counting noncrossing perfect matchings of basepair edges.
As a motivating example of how to count noncrossing perfect matchings,
let c_n denote the number of noncrossing perfect matchings in the complete graph K_{2n}.
After setting c_0 = 1, we can see that c_1 should equal 1 as well.
As for the case of a general n, say that the nodes of K_{2n} are labeled with the positive
integers from 1 to 2n.  We can join node 1 to any of the remaining 2n - 1 nodes;
yet once we have chosen this node (say m), we cannot add another edge to the matching that crosses the edge \{1, m\}.
As a result, we must match all the edges on one side of \{1, m\} to each other. This requirement
forces m to be even, so that we can write m = 2k for some positive integer k.
There are 2k - 2 nodes on one side of \{1, m\} and 2n - 2k nodes on the other side of \{1, m\}, so that
in turn there will be c_{k-1} \cdot c_{n - k} different ways of forming a perfect matching on the remaining nodes of K_{2n}.
If we let m vary over all possible n - 1 choices of even numbers between 1 and 2n,
then we obtain the recurrence relation c_n = \sum_{k = 1}^{n}{c_{k-1} \cdot c_{n-k}}.
The resulting numbers c_n counting noncrossing perfect matchings in K_{2n} are called
the Catalan numbers, and they appear in a huge number of other settings.  See Figure 4
for an illustration counting the first four Catalan numbers.
Given: An RNA string s having the same number of occurrences of 'A' as 'U' and the same number
of occurrences of 'C' as 'G'. The length of the string is at most 300 bp.
Return: The total number of noncrossing perfect matchings of basepair edges in the bonding
graph of s, modulo 1,000,000.
