Longest Path in a DAG Problem
Find a longest path between two nodes in an edge-weighted DAG.
Given: An integer representing the source node of a graph, followed by an integer representing the sink node of the graph, followed by an edge-weighted graph. The graph is represented by a modified adjacency list in which the notation "0->1:7" indicates that an edge connects node 0 to node 1 with weight 7.
Return: The length of a longest path in the graph, followed by a longest path. (If multiple longest paths exist, you may return any one.)
