A gap is a contiguous sequence of spaces in a row of an alignment. One way to score gaps more appropriately is to define an affine penalty for a gap of length k as σ + ε · (k − 1), where σ is the gap opening penalty, assessed to the first symbol in the gap, and ε is the gap extension penalty, assessed to each additional symbol in the gap. We typically select ε to be smaller than σ so that the affine penalty for a gap of length k is smaller than the penalty for k independent single-nucleotide indels (σ · k).
Alignment with Affine Gap Penalties Problem
Construct a highest-scoring global alignment of two strings (with affine gap penalties).
Given: Two amino acid strings v and w (each of length at most 100).
Return: The maximum alignment score between v and w, followed by an alignment of v and w achieving this maximum score. Use the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix, a gap opening penalty of 11, and a gap extension penalty of 1.
