The Trim algorithm, shown below, sorts all peptides in Leaderboard according
to their scores, resulting in a sorted Leaderboard. Trim> then retains the
top N scoring peptides including ties, and removes all other peptides from Leaderboard.
Trim(Leaderboard, Spectrum, N, AminoAcid, AminoAcidMass)
    for j ← 1 to |Leaderboard|
        Peptide ← j-th peptide in Leaderboard
        LinearScores(j) ← LinearScore(Peptide, Spectrum)
    sort Leaderboard according to the decreasing order of scores in LinearScores
    sort LinearScores in decreasing order
    for j ← N + 1 to |Leaderboard|
        if LinearScores(j) < LinearScores(N)
            remove all peptides starting from the j-th peptide from Leaderboard
        return Leaderboard
    return Leaderboard

Trim Problem
Trim a leaderboard of peptides. 
Given: A leaderboard of linear peptides Leaderboard, a linear spectrum Spectrum, and an integer N.
Return: The top N peptides from Leaderboard scored against Spectrum.  Remember to use LinearScore.
