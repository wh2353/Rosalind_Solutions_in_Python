We encountered GreedyMotifSearch in “Implement GreedyMotifSearch”. In this problem, we will power it up with pseudocounts.
Implement GreedyMotifSearch with Pseudocounts
Given: Integers k and t, followed by a collection of strings Dna.
Return: A collection of strings BestMotifs resulting from running GreedyMotifSearch(Dna, k, t) with pseudocounts.  If at any step you find more than one Profile-most probable k-mer in a given string, use the one occurring first.
