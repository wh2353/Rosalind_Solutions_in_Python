Problem
The task is to use Bellman-Ford algorithm to check whether a given graph
contains a cycle of negative weight.
Given: A positive integer k \le 20 and k simple directed graphs with integer edge weights from -10^{3} to 10^3 and n \le 10^3 vertices in the edge list format.
Return: For each graph, output "1" if it contains a negative weight cycle and "-1" otherwise.
